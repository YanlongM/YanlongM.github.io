		<p>A Zoological garden</p>

<p>Where the iron exists as if to remind brothers that they are brothers, and to call a halt to the bloody-minded hunt.</p>
<p>Where the Germans go to drink beer.</p>
<p>And the fair sex to sell themselves.</p>
<p>Where the eagles, appointed today, sit in eternities with no sign of evening.</p>
<p>Where the camel, with lofty hump bearing no rider, knows the riddle of Buddhism and melts the grimace of China.</p>
<p>Where only the stag a-flower like a great rock is timid still.</p>
<p>Where the dresses of the people come alive.</p>
<p>Where they walk scowling and in concentration and the Germans bloom with health.</p>
<p>Where the black glance of the swan clad always in winter - its beak brown and yellow as an autumn grove - is guarded and suspicious even of itself.</p>
<p>Where the blue peacock drops its tail to the ground as though from the peacock-stone of Siberia, thrown from clouds
	in light-blue fretwork and falling on forest gold and green, all various shades owing to the uneven ground.</p>
<p>Where you feel like snatching the tails from the emus to strike up chords and sing of the deeds of the Russians.</p>
