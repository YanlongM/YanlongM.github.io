      <h1>Rob Giampietro and David Reinfurt: FROM 0 TO 1</h1><br>

      <h2>INFORMATION ON LIBRARIES</h2><br>

      <p>0: To begin let me ask straight out: are there any off-limit areas?</p>

      <p>1: I certainly can’t think of any, apart from the music, of course.</p>

      <p>0: I’ve recently been thinking about libraries, and I know this is a conversation we’ve shared off and on for a while. Perhaps I’ll pick it back up, now. The first libraries were based on an archive model, a safe place for important records. They housed mostly commercial transactions and inventories recorded on clay tablets. as the library developed, it retained this archival function, but on July 1, 1731, Benjamin Franklin and the Leather apron Club of Philadelphia established the first public Circulating Library. Books were quite expensive at the time and by pooling resources, many volumes could be shared among contributing members. One was free to borrow any book for a length of time, return it, and borrow another. This new library was built to expand and evolve, a shifting arrangement of ideas and objects constantly circulating in a concentrated community of committed readers. In recent years, yet another library model has materialized, specifically online, which might be called the Distributing Library. The Internet archive or The Gutenberg Project are perhaps examples, where a large collection of documents are collected together electronically and made available free for download. Instead of 50,000 books, one copy each, sealed in an archive; or 15,000 books, a few copies each, all constantly circulating; the Distributing Library offers any number of “books,” with unlimited copies, all available free to be downloaded, digested, dispersed. now, if the archive Model essentially treats books as capital, investing them back into the institution in order to reinforce and expand the reach of the library, and the Circulating Library constitutes a gift economy by freely sharing the books in its collection through a network of benign strangers, then what economic model corresponds to the Distributing Library?
      </p>

      <p>1: Libraries started out as a single building whose assets were the property of the sovereign or state. Through the work of Franklin and others, libraries evolved into a set of branches whose assets were the property of a membership, township, or community. The archive is one place. The branch system is many places. When you examine this progression, the makeup (or perhaps the markup) of the Distributing Library becomes clearer. It has a slippery relationship to place because it is housed on an infinite number of servers and accessed though an infinite number of web browsers. It also has a slippery relationship to its own assets. The library’s assets are not there to be merely stored or loaned. The Distributing Library’s assets are there, really, to be copied.</p>

        <p>
        In the days of the archive, there were few copies and few originals. Taxes may have helped to fund the library, but fundamentally it was controlled by the state and therefore all information was controlled by the state as well. The structure was so centralized that it was a gift economy’s virtual opposite. Writing in The Gift, Lewis Hyde gives the case of enrico Malatesta, head of an anarchist gang who hid out in the woods near naples trying to unravel the state one archive at a time. Here’s Hyde quoting historian James Joll: “at the village of Lentino the column arrived on a Sunday morning, declared King Victor emanuel deposed and carried out the anarchist ritual of burning the archives which contained the record of property holdings, debts, and taxes.” The uprising happened in 1877, nearly 150 years after Franklin’s revolutionary new Circulating Library model was functioning in america. It is as if Malatesta had realized that the state was relying on an outmoded library technology, the archive, to exert control. at the same time, the increasing circulation of books from Gutenberg onward had created a more literate citizenry and therefore a more informed (and demanding) public. Information wanted to be free, open, and available to everyone, as Franklin’s library was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Leather apron Club was also known as the JUNTO, a word Franklin adapted from the Spanish verb “to join.” Sharing books empowered these mostly middle-class, highly-literate merchants. Sharing also eroded some of the hierarchy the archive created between civilians and the state. Finally, sharing books established what Hyde calls a “feeling bond” among members of Franklin’s circle, a sense of union. E pluribus unum. The Junto’s roots were not in book collecting but in discussion. It was a social club before it was a library. This is telling. In the days of the archive, items existed to be looked up one-by-one on your own. With the advent of the Circulating Library, items existed to be discussed by a group. now with the Distributing Library, a further change is taking place. Let’s tune our radios back to December 2008 and listen to Lawrence Lessig speaking to Terry Gross on NPR:</p>

        <a>Copyright law was architected for a world where copies were the exception. [...] In the digital age, every single thing we do with creative work on a digital network produces a copy, so that the act of reading on a digital network produces a copy. The act of sharing my book with my mother produces a copy. Any of these activities which in real space don’t produce a copy, in cyberspace produce a copy.</a>
        <p>
          The Circulating Library model was not a digital model, it was a real-world model. In the real world, you have to surrender ownership to increase access. In the digital world, you don’t. In the real world, information content (a text) is wedded to a physical form (a book). In the digital world, information content (a text) exists as one layer separable from digital form (a PDF, email, blog post, text-to-speech reading, etc).Thus while Franklin’s club had shifted the emphasis on how books were used from owned objects of study to shared objects for conversation, the Distributing Library continues and deepens that idea of culture as conversation. even if you wanted to burn the library down now, you couldn’t: its users have made a thousand copies of it, ready to take the place of the original. Few of those users feel that what they’ve done is wrong: they want to do whatever they want with the content they’ve accessed. Therefore, it’s time for the state to play catch up, and that’s why there’s so much upheaval in copyright law, in newspaper publishing, in the distribution of music, and so much more. We are experiencing a massive shift from the Library of alexandria to Google Books. They may be comparable, but they’re not the same. Does that answer your question?

<p>0: Yes, in part. But, frankly I’m surprised at your naive distinction between the “real” and the “digital” worlds. Does the computer and its contents no longer belong to the same world that we live in? Digital information may appear disembodied, but it is always nothing more than a collection of simple electric charges, on or off, 1 or 0. and, if you don’t believe me, try grabbing your plugged-in Macbook by the motherboard, and you’re in for a jolt of reality.</p>
<p>
1: Maybe the distinction isn’t between “real” or “virtual,” maybe it’s simply between “analog” or “digital.” Circulating and Distributing libraries provide two different platforms with some different possibilities. But when you’re trying to optimize how the information is used, it’s possible to be platform independent. Information wants to be free, accessible to whomever, wherever, however.
</p>
<p>0: “Information wants to be free”? Does it really? The second half of Stewart Brand’s aphorism is often conveniently omitted, so I’ll include it here for you:</p>
<a>Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive. Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy, and recombine—too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about price, copyright, “intellectual property,” the moral rightness of casual distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse, not better.</a>
<p>1: But Brand’s aphorism makes a cost distinction. I’m making a use distinction. They’re quite different. Maybe we should rewrite him: “Information wants to be freed.”</p>
<p>0: nice one. But still, the tired rhetoric of “free information” has its roots in the mid-20th century discourse of norbert Weiner’s Cybernetics and Claude Shannon’s Information Theory, which model a communications system that isolates information from its carrier. Technically, this may be correct—and yet, I challenge you to find me some information that arrives without a vehicle ... Perhaps this is why our conversation here, now, makes some sense in a bulletin about books. Books are a particularly robust vehicle for delivering information, and I think you’ll agree that the form of the book is as important as the information it carries for the total message delivered.</p>

          <h2>INFORMATION ON RECORDING</h2><br>
          <p>0: May I speak now?</p>
          <p>1: Of course. I didn’t mean to get carried away, but—</p>
          <p>0: You mentioned typesetters. While preparing the second edition of The Art of Computer Programming in the early 1980s, Donald Knuth received the galley proofs and was quite upset by what he saw. His publisher had just switched to a digital typesetting system and the typographic quality of this edition was far below the first. Knuth realized that typesetting only meant arranging 0’s and 1’s (ink and no ink) in the proper pattern, and figured, as a computer programmer, he could do something about it. He spent the next ten years developing TeX as a language for writers to directly produce high-quality typesetting. as opposed to industry-standard page layout programs that implement a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) paradigm, TeX produces “What You See Is What You Mean” (WYSIWYM) by using plain text files and a semantic mark-up language compiled on-the-fly to produce final pages.</p>
          <p>1: Run that by me again.</p>
          <p>0: Generally speaking, since the invention of movable type, the type- setting of a book’s pages has followed the same model—“What You See Is What You Get.” Typographic technologies have changed at a constantly accelerating pace from steel punch-cuts to Monotype’s lead- slugs to phototypesetting’s chemical emulsions and finally to the exclusively digital production of typeset pages. each one of these relies on a human operator, or typesetter, to translate the texts into typographic form and compose the page. as the typesetter works, he sees the full page compositely formed before his eyes. Whether assembling metal letters in-between rows of leading (while reading backwards) or preparing long typographic galleys on Linotronic paper, the typesetter sees what he is making as he is making it. even in a digital software program such as adobe InDesign, the operator is given a full-page interface where type- setting choices are reflected back in real time. What You See Is What You Get. But, with the appearance of the computer, Knuth realized, another possibility had arrived.
          (This may be what you were getting at a while back when you suggested that “Information wants to be freed ...”) Computer software can be delegated the technical work of assembling lines of letters comfortably on a page. and this kind of brute-force automation and progressive problem solving is likely the work for which the digital computer is best-suited. So, if software can automatically perform the rote tasks of typesetting, that leaves the writer (who has also been electronically enfranchised as producer) free to make page layouts by simply instructing the computer as to what she means. The writer prepares a text that says what it says, but also includes the structural relationships between the parts of the text. “This is a headline.” Or “The next paragraph is a quotation.” When this kind of text-as-structure is passed to an automated typesetting system, the result is What You See Is What You Mean. This is where the moral objection comes in. Once the typographic decisions have been passed over to software, then the information no longer is tied to any one specific form. The possibilities multiply. It can find any of many forms from electronic text message to glossy magazine to Portable Document Format. The transitions are increasingly fluid, increasingly automatic. But instead of prying itself from its carrier, the information becomes, paradoxically, more specifically bound to its medium. The communication is always a combination of what is being said and how what is being said is being delivered. The medium remains the message, and ever-increasingly so.

          <p>1: Ultimately, you’re right, not just about books, but about the medium of language itself. Let me try to respond by splicing several different speakers from several different sources. The first is MIT Media Lab founder nicholas negroponte, who wrote a column for Wired in 1996 about his newly released book Being Digital:</p>
          <a>What weighs less than one millionth of an ounce, consumes less than a millionth of a cubic inch, holds 4 million bits, and costs less than US$2? What weighs more than 1 pound, is larger than 50 cubic inches, contains less than 4 million bits, and costs more than $20? The same thing: Being DigiTaL stored on an integrated circuit and Being DigiTaL published as a hardcover book. [...] We seldom carve words in rocks these days, we will probably not print many of them on paper for binding tomorrow. in fact, the cost of paper (which has risen 50 percent in the past year), the amount of human energy required to move it, and the volume of space needed to store it make books as we know them less than the optimum method for delivering bits. in fact, the art of bookmaking is not only less than perfect but will probably be as relevant in 2020 as blacksmithing is today.</a>
          <p>Paul Conway, the former head of Yale University Library’s Preservation Department, might draw a different conclusion. In an essay also from 1996 titled “Preservation in the Digital World,” Conway writes:</p>
          <a>Our capacity to record information has increased exponentially over time while the longevity of the media used to store the information has decreased equivalently. [...] in order to achieve the kind of information density that is common today, we must depend on machines that rapidly reach obsolescence to create information and then make it readable and intelligible.</a>
          <p>Conway compares modern information technology to the book publishing boom of the 1850s when more books than ever were being printed smaller, cheaper, and faster. While “illuminated manuscripts and other documents from Medieval times are quite able to withstand centuries more study and admiration,” Conway notes, “Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, or The Whale, first published in 1851 on typically acidic paper, symbolizes the worldwide preservation challenges of all 19th- and 20th- century publishing.” In cases like Moby Dick, the medium, literally, was disintegrating, and taking the message with it.</p>
          <p>acid-free paper wasn’t developed until the 1950s and is often symbol- ized today with a ringed infinity symbol appearing on the book’s copyright page. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, a different kind of deconstruction was challenging the book’s material (if not physical) form. Derrida opens his 1972 book Dissemination with an “Outwork,” a text that, as he explains, exists externally to the book itself.</p>

          <h1>What is code? </h1>
          <p>Software has been around since the 1940s. Which means that people have been faking their way through meetings about software, and the code that builds it, for generations. Now that software lives in our pockets, runs our cars and homes, and dominates our waking lives, ignorance is no longer acceptable. The world belongs to people who code. Those who don’t understand will be left behind.</p>
          <p>This issue comprises a single story devoted to ­demystifying code and the culture of the people who make it. There’s some technical language along with a few pretty basic mathematical concepts. There are also lots of solid jokes and lasting insights. It may take a few hours to read, but that’s a small price to pay for adding decades to your career.

<p>You are an educated, successful person capable of abstract thought. A VP doing an SVP’s job. Your office, appointed with decent furniture and a healthy amount of natural light filtered through vertical blinds, is commensurate with nearly two decades of service to the craft of management.</p>
<p>Copper plaques on the wall attest to your various leadership abilities inside and outside the organization: One, the Partner in Innovation Banquet Award 2011, is from the sales team for your support of its 18-month effort to reduce cycle friction—net sales increased 6.5 percent; another, the Civic Guidelight 2008, is for overseeing a volunteer team that repainted a troubled public school top to bottom.</p>
<p>You have a reputation throughout the organization as a careful person, bordering on penny-pinching. The way you’d put it is, you are loath to pay for things that can’t be explained. You expect your staff to speak in plain language. This policy has served you well in many facets of operations, but it hasn’t worked at all when it comes to overseeing software development.</p>
<p>For your entire working memory, some Internet thing has come along every two years and suddenly hundreds of thousands of dollars (inevitably millions) must be poured into amorphous projects with variable deadlines. Content management projects, customer relationship management integration projects, mobile apps, paperless office things, global enterprise resource planning initiatives—no matter how tightly you clutch the purse strings, software finds a way to pry open your fingers.</p>
<p>Here we go again. On the other side of your (well-organized) desk sits this guy in his mid-30s with a computer in his lap. He’s wearing a taupe blazer. He’s come to discuss spending large sums to create intangible abstractions on a “website re-architecture project.” He needs money, support for his team, new hires, external resources. It’s preordained that you’ll give these things to him, because the CEO signed off on the initiative—and yet should it all go pear-shaped, you will be responsible. Coders are insanely expensive, and projects that start with uncomfortably large budgets have an ugly tendency to grow from there. You need to understand where the hours will go.</p>
