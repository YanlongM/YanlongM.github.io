		<p>We don't do good work. Good work is not enough;</p>
		<p>We need to do great work. We invent new tools.</p>
			<p>That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.</p>
				<p>We need inspiration to inspire. Share your experiences, ideas, failures, successes. </p>
					<p>We tolerate failure. Failureis part of the process.</p>
						<p>We collaborate. Collaboration does not mean consensus. </p>
							<p>We generate ideas. Idea generation is not idea selection. </p>
								<p>We like making stuff. Useful, beautiful, important things. </p>
									<p>We dare say no. Saying yes is often just laziness. </p>
										<p>We like surprises. We have to mistrust our own routines. </p>
											<p>It's your company, too. If something can be done better, don't wait for permission.</p></div>
