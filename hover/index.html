    <p>0: I’ve recently been thinking about libraries, and I know this is a conversation we’ve shared off and on for a while. Perhaps I’ll pick it
back up, now. The first libraries were based on an archive model, a safe place for important records.
<span class= "number">1</span> They housed mostly commercial transactions and inventories recorded on clay tablets. as the library developed, it retained this archival function, but on July 1, 1731, Benjamin Franklin
and the Leather apron Club of Philadelphia established the first public Circulating Library. Books were quite expensive at the time and by pooling resources, many volumes could be shared among contributing members. One was free to borrow any book for a length of time, return
it, and borrow another. This new library was built to expand and evolve,
a shifting arrangement of ideas and objects constantly circulating in a concentrated community of committed readers. In recent years, yet another library model has materialized, specifically online, which might be called the Distributing Library. The Internet archive or The Gutenberg Project are perhaps examples, where a large collection of documents are collected together electronically and made available free for download. Instead of 50,000 books, one copy each, sealed in an archive; or 15,000 books, a few copies each, all constantly circulating; the Distributing Library offers any number of “books,” with unlimited copies, all available free to be downloaded, digested, dispersed. now, if the archive Model essentially treats books as capital, investing them back into the institution in order to reinforce and expand the reach of the library, and the Circulating Library constitutes a gift economy by freely sharing the books in its collection through a network of benign strangers, then what economic model corresponds to the Distributing Library?
